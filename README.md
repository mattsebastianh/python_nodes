# Python Nodes

A simple Python project demonstrating a basic `Node` class with linked nodes and test cases.

## Overview
This project provides a minimal implementation of a singly linked node structure in Python. Each node stores a value, an optional link to another node, and a name. The script includes test cases to illustrate usage and node linking.

## Features
- `Node` class with:
	- Value storage
	- Optional link to another node
	- Name attribute
	- Methods for getting/setting value and link
- Example usage and test cases
- Console output for demonstration

## Usage
Run the script directly:

```bash
python script.py
```

You will see output demonstrating node creation, linking, and value retrieval.

## Example
```
Object instance created. value: 'likes to yak'
Object instance created. value: 'has a penchant for hoarding snacks'
Object instance created. value: 'enjoys spending time in movie lots'
<Node object 'yacko'>
<Node object 'wacko'>
<Node object 'dot'>
<Node object 'dot'>
None
<Node object 'wacko'>
Dot's value:
enjoys spending time in movie lots
Wacko's value:
has a penchant for hoarding snacks
...
```
